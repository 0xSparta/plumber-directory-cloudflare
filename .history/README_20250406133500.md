## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on Cloudflare Pages with hybrid rendering:

- Home page and essential pages are statically generated at build time
- Detail pages (plumber, state, city) use on-demand rendering for faster builds
- Stays well within Cloudflare Pages build limits by minimizing statically built pages

## Recent Improvements

### Build Optimization

- Implemented on-demand rendering (ODR) with Cloudflare to significantly reduce build times
- Converted plumber detail pages from static to server-rendered to avoid build time exhaustion
- Changed state and city pages to on-demand rendering to further reduce static build size
- Updated Astro configuration to use hybrid rendering mode with Cloudflare adapter

### Image Handling

- Added fallback SVG icons for missing images
- Redesigned homepage hero section to avoid external image dependencies
- Improved error handling for missing images throughout the site

### Route Generation

- Updated dynamic route generation to include all plumbers
- Enhanced error handling for non-existent routes

## Performance Considerations

- The site uses a hybrid rendering approach:
  - Critical, frequently accessed pages are static for maximum performance
  - Detail pages are rendered on-demand to optimize build times
- Image handling is optimized to avoid network requests for missing resources
- Data loading is optimized to reduce memory usage during builds

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
