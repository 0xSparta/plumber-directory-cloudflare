# Plumber Directory Website Plan

## Objective

Build a programmatic SEO plumber directory website using Astro, DaisyUI, and Tailwind CSS, prioritizing SEO and performance, with a focus on meeting Cloudflare Pages' 20K file limit.

## Dataset Analysis

The dataset contains plumber information across the USA with the following key details:

- Plumber information (name, address, phone, website, hours, etc.)
- Reviews and ratings
- Location data (city, state, coordinates)
- Images
- Some plumbers lack address/city/state information

## Architecture Plans

### Option 1: Full Static Generation

Generate all pages statically at build time:

- Home page with search and featured plumbers
- State pages listing cities
- City pages listing plumbers
- Individual plumber pages
- Special handling for plumbers without location

#### Pros:

- Excellent SEO performance
- Fast page loads
- Complete indexing by search engines

#### Cons:

- May exceed Cloudflare's 20K file limit
- Long build times

### Option 2: Hybrid Static/Dynamic Approach

- Generate key pages statically (home, states, popular cities)
- Use dynamic routes for less common cities and individual plumbers
- Server-side rendering for dynamic routes

#### Pros:

- Stays within file limits
- Balance between SEO and feasibility

#### Cons:

- Slightly slower performance for dynamic pages
- More complex implementation

### Option 3: API-driven Static Generation

- Create a static frontend with key pages
- Build a serverless API to serve plumber data
- Client-side rendering for detailed listings

#### Pros:

- Minimal static files
- Fast builds

#### Cons:

- Poorer SEO for dynamic content
- Slower initial page loads

## Selected Approach: Enhanced Hybrid Model

Implement a modified version of Option 2 with these enhancements:

1. **Core Static Pages:**

   - Home, About, Contact, Privacy, Terms
   - State index pages
   - Top 100 cities by plumber density
   - Top 1000 plumbers by review count

2. **Dynamic Routes:**

   - Generate dynamic routes for remaining cities and plumbers
   - Implement efficient data fetching from JSON

3. **File Limit Solution:**

   - Split the large JSON dataset into smaller chunks by state
   - Implement data lazy-loading at runtime
   - Use Cloudflare's edge functions if needed

4. **SEO Optimizations:**

   - Comprehensive meta tags
   - Schema.org structured data
   - XML sitemaps (split by category)
   - Canonical URLs
   - robots.txt configuration

5. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Image optimization with responsive sizing
