        "Description": "The toilet in my apartment was acting funky last week, so I put in a work order with my management company. I missed a call from Marina at Hometown Plumbing. When I was finally able to return the call, Marina was super helpful and very efficient with getting me scheduled. Friendliness is so underrated today, and I really appreciated the brief conversation we shared. She scheduled Michael to come out and take a look at the issue. Michale arrived on the dot and was also very friendly. He quickly diagnosed the issue, fixed it, picked up after himself, and gave a little advice. Michael was very attentive and conscious of my home. I'd totally recommend Hometown Plumbing for any of plumbing needs.",

So I called Hometown plumbing got an appointment for them to come and fix it. I immediately got a text, saying Aaron would be out between 3 pm and 430pm today. Aaron called me at 1:30 and asked if he could come early. After getting to our house and assessing the problem he quickly figured out a plan. After removing the old flange found, we had a big chunk of concrete missing. Aaron talked to my husband about what he had planned and how to fix it. Next thing we knew the concrete was fixed. The new flange was installed and he even installed our Toilet. Can\u2019t ask for anything better than a quick response, honest, and hard working. We will definitely use Hometown plumbing again in the future if a need arises.Thank you Aaron.",

        "Description": "A-1 Plumbing in Bakersfield provided one of the most unprofessional and outright disappointing service experiences imaginable. From the owner down to the employees, their behavior was completely unacceptable. Not only did they fail to complete the plumbing repair correctly, but they also caused significant damage to my cabinetry and failed to properly repair the wall. Instead of addressing the issue professionally, they laughed, made a complete mess, and disrespected my home.\n\nTo make matters worse, their attitude was nothing short of appalling. They openly made rude comments about my dog, even going as far as to say they would throw them out. The lack of professionalism and basic respect was beyond frustrating.\n\nThis so-called \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d plumbing company operates in an outdated, careless, and unaccountable manner, showing no regard for their customers or their property. Their dismissive and rude behavior, combined with subpar workmanship, makes it clear that they should not be trusted with any plumbing job. If you value quality service, respect, and professionalism, avoid A-1 Plumbing in Bakersfield at all costs",

We found a leak coming from inside a wall, and he came prepared with everything he needed to cut into the wall (carefully and locally after hearing the background and doing a little detective work of his own on-site) and fix the leak. Bryant was careful with the drywall he removed, so I can reinstall and seal it once everything dries out. He answered our questions patiently and thoroughly before leaving us with a clean fix and a secure home. Both helpful and friendly when we called the after-hours line, he made us feel like we\u2019d called the right company, and once we ended the call, he got here fast, too! With zero attempted upsells and a terrific attitude the whole time, Bryant has definitely earned our business for the next time we need a plumber.",

We initially hired them about 2 years ago to address a backup issue in our bathrooms, and Jake did such an excellent job that we didn't hesitate to call him again when we encountered a more pressing plumbing issue.\n\nJake was very responsive and honest about the extent of the damage to our main water line. His professionalism and transparency were truly appreciated, as it allowed us to make an informed decision without any surprises. The team that Jake assembled, including Stephen, was quick, efficient, and respectful throughout the entire process. They worked diligently to ensure that the job was completed to our satisfaction, and they were careful to minimize any disruption to our daily lives (as I work from home).\n\nOverall, we are extremely satisfied with the services provided by Precision Plumbing.\n\nWe would highly recommend Precision Plumbing to anyone in need of plumbing services, whether for a minor repair or a major project. :)",

They arrived on time and got right to work. They were able to clear it sufficiently so that I could continue using my machine. He pointed out how really old the pipes were and would probably require further attention somewhere down the line. I had a lot happening in my life at the time and told him that I would definitely give him a call back to finish it up sometime in the near future.

When an emergency like that occurs, you want to know you have a company you can trust and count on and Titan Plumbing is definitely that company. The owners and all the employees make you feel like your job is important and they really care. When I call, I request Jason. He has been a plumber for 20+ years. He is very knowledgeable, knows what he is doing, and is always on your side. He is fast and efficient. I have had other employees come out to my home and have never had any issues with them either.

From the moment I explained my situation, they completely rearranged their schedule to get a plumber to my house within two hours. Knowing I had already gone a week without hot water, Ronald went above and beyond\u2014calling multiple plumbing part suppliers to track down the necessary parts and ensuring my water heater was repaired as quickly as possible. The level of customer service and dedication was outstanding. Thanks to Ronald and the team, my family finally has hot water again. Highly recommend The Plumbing Doc for their professionalism, responsiveness, and top-notch service!",

It   took him about 30mins and he took the old toilet and trash with him. He charged me the service\nfee to come back out and install it.\nThe whole process was so easy and affordable.\nThank you!",

That does not justify his employee\u2019s reckless driving. He called me rude even though his employee almost hit my car with his company truck. Yet I\u2019m the rude one even though anyone would be upset if their car almost got hit by a big company truck. I explained to him where we were at and yet all he said was \u201cwell I have 6 trucks and they\u2019re new so I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean to hit you\u201d. Instead of taking liability of his employees action and extremely reckless driving with his big company truck. He was no help and just argued with me about my experience. I don\u2019t want to scratch my car either yet I\u2019m not cutting people off and driving recklessly. This is the type of customer service you will be looking forward to apparently if you have a grievance with this company.

They stated the leak was from a leaking faucet and would have to get authorization from the Home Warranty company after receiving authorization stated that they would order the part. I confirm with them as I have text that the part would be equal and similar value, a few days later after multiple attempts to contact them and set up an appointment, I was unavailable to be there for the appointment and left my daughter to let them in when I was available after viewing the replacement item and previously confirming that it would be a vehicle or similar value. The item was not they stated that they were only authorized  to provide a builders quality and after confirming with choice, the authorization was for $70. My faucet was still under warranty, so I planned off setting the hundred dollars of which my home warranty company charged me for the repairs with returning the faucet and receiving my prorated amount, but to my  Dismay, the tech had taken the faucet after contacting A1 Plumbing . They said they would get the faucet back to me. Also provided in a text, but within minute stated that they no longer had the faucet and would be unable to provide. I stated that was unacceptable. They were never given permission to take from my home , and asked them to do the right thing and either returning the value of the faucet or the faucet itself I contacted my warranty company and told them I deemed this as theft. They were in agreement after hearing my side of the story and stated they would escalate this further informed A1 Plumbing  That they need to do what is right or I will pursue this in small claims court and file a complaint of theft with the police department at this time they have not chosen to do what is right so I have no choice but to pursue legal stay away from this company  You\u2019ll be out more than a leaking faucet .",

He was able to inform me that my unit was 21 years old and gave me wonderful payment options for a brand new unit. Unfortunately, at this time I\u2019m not able to afford a brand new unit. Brian was able to find the motherboard that was needed for the current unit that I have and had it fixed by 12:30 on the same day. He went out of his way to help our small family and ensure that we\u2019re able to keep our little daughter warm.",

Very professional, communicative, and joked around with me and made me feel like I was family!  They covered my floors so they didn\u2019t scuff anything up, they covered my son\u2019s entire closet so they did not get any of his shoes or clothes dirty!  They left my house cleaner than when they came lol!  These guys worked Non stop, and did not complain one time!  I loved the fact that it seemed like they met prior to my install, came up with a gameplan and executed flawlessly!  They even inspected each others work and gave insight on how to improve prior to completion!  Wow!!!  Just WOW!!!  Can Do Crew is actual the team that Can Do!!!!  Thank you so much!!!! The least I could Do was Buy them Lunch!",

Marcos came out and assessed the problem and told us exactly what we needed and how much it would cost.\n\nWe\u2019re scheduled a time, the work was done efficiently. I liked that Marcos and his helper Derek, answered all my questions. They also stayed until all the joints were dry and tested the entire system.\n\nPhillip, the scheduler, texted me every time someone was on their way. The estimator was fantastic as well. He set the price and I thought it was very reasonable. If I have home plumbing issues, these are the guys I\u2019m going to call.",

From the start, they were professional, friendly, and very knowledgeable.\n\nJulian and Vincent arrived on time and took their time to assess the issue with my air conditioning unit. They explained what was wrong in a way that was easy to understand and provided me with clear options for repair. I appreciated their transparency and willingness to answer all my questions.\n\nThe repair process was efficient, and they worked diligently to ensure everything was fixed properly. Not only did they restore my AC to perfect working condition, but they also took the time to clean up after the job was done, which I really appreciated.\n\nI highly recommend HPS Mechanical and specifically thank Julian and Vincent for their outstanding service. It\u2019s rare to find such dedicated professionals, and I will definitely call them for any future HVAC needs!",

I\u2019m gonna pray for you. You never know what someone\u2019s going through at the end of the day hustle is a hustle. We\u2019re just out here trying to feed our family and instead we\u2019re getting laughed at and mocked at  while people are on the job at the end of the day your job isn\u2019t any better than mine you do plumbing with all due respect so your job is essentially the same as our hustle right now . I really pray that you men that I saw laughing and mocking my husband do not do this again to someone else . We live in a cruel world it takes not even one second to be kind.\nMake sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.\n1 Thessalonians 5:15 NIV",

I had to shut off my water to the house to stop the leak, which was inconvenient to say the least. I had another plumbing company come out prior but they did not have the parts and had to order them which caused me to continue to be without water in my home. Their technician Christian was very professional and expedient in his work. Advanced plumbing carries 95% of the parts needed on their trucks which enabled them to get the job done right away. I would definitely recommend and use them again in the future.",

I was so thrilled they were responsive 24/7, I had reached out to them on a weekend during the night, with my own plunging emergency. They showed up quickly and the young man was great, he listened closely to my situation he was friendly, positive and very reassuring about the work solution ahead. Thankfully he has everything he needed in his nice looking, well stocked company van.\nI was impressed how he made sure to keep the work area clean as he progressed on my repairs. He vacuumed up water from the damage area and ran a fan to help dry the water on the floor.\nIn the end the work was completed and everything was working perfectly. The experience working with America\u2019s Best Plumbing was better than I could have imagined. I would recommend them to anyone and I plan call them in the future again.",

However they used my personal bathing towels to clean up the mess and left just about every light on in my place. Well fast forward to Tuesday night and I notice the flooding again. Mind you it's is the day before a holiday. So I think to myself I'm screwed until Thursday. I call my complex again and reach the emergency line. At this time it's about 5 am on a holiday. My apartment manager calls and informs me someone from this company is coming out and would be there shortly. Well, by the time they came I had fell back asleep and when I realized he was knocking on my door and woke up, he was gone. I call the company and let them know my situation and she infomed me the tech will be calling me. He arrived about 20 minutes later, did his thing and fixed my issue. Carlos even straightened up after himself which I really appreciated because I'm scheduled for a surgery soon and cannot due much of anything right now.

I asked him nicely to move and instead was rude. I called the office and the receptionist was just as rude. When I asked to speak to her boss or owner she lied saying she was the boss and hung up on me. I called back to ask her name and who owned the company because I did not believe an owner of the company whose other employees besides Matt or her have been very professional. Her smart mouth says Stanley plumbing hello. I said well you said your the owner so this is the professionalism of the wife?  She hung up on me after saying I can walk. Absolutely disgusted and disappointed with this company. My place and the one he is working at with door open has not one vehicle parked on that side. I came home from urgent care and this is what I had to deal with. Thanks for kindness Matt truck #18 as you said sitting in your van and the sweet receptionist that co-signed your rudness. This company sure has changed.",

        "Description": "I had an emergency and needed the water to my swamp cooler shut off but couldn't find the shut off valve. I have a fear of falling and couldn't get on my roof. I called at like 5/6 in the morning. I started to leave a message and someone picked up before I even finished my first sentence... They gave me a reasonable early time to help me... I am recovering from a slew of mental health issues and Brian made me feel like a proper customer without judgement. He talked to me professionally and got the job done extremely quick. He explained everything and let me know they will come back if it isn't corrected, but it's already apparent that he fixed it. He even showed me the issues as best he could.. Even the lady on the phone who took my payment was so sweet. I seriously can't thank them enough. Probably will be my number one plumber from here on out",

It\u2019s been three years since I lost Ramiro, and though time has passed, I still find myself wanting to run to him any time something goes wrong. My husband was my savior in every aspect of life\u2014he supported, protected, and provided for me in ways big and small. Facing these moments without him isn\u2019t easy, but I remembered meeting some amazing people, Jack and his wife, through networking, so I reached out to them.\n\nJack and his team came out quickly and not only fixed the problem but patiently explained everything along the way. They walked me through the issue, gave me different options to handle it, and even let me linger as I tried to wrap my head around how to prevent something like this in the future. I\u2019m still learning how to be \u201cthe adult\u201d now, as funny as that may sound. My husband truly spoiled me, and while life looks different now, I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the relief they provided.\n\nKnowing I have one less thing to worry about, despite everything else going on, is a gift I don\u2019t take lightly. Thank you, Do It Right Plumbing, for your expertise, kindness, and the peace of mind you\u2019ve given me.",

Anthony came over the same day and took care of it and even left me an extra allen wrench! He was competent and super respectful, I would highly recommend Homespun Plumbing.",

However, he sent me to the hardware store to purchase a new hose bib as he did not have the part.\n\nNow the surprise - $480 for a little less than 2 hours work.  This didn't involve a lot of parts, digging, or anything else.  I had a hose bib I could not remove and a bent copper pipe behind it.  The pipe was outside the house.  $480 just seems WAY out of line - that comes to $240/hour!\n\nI don't understand this company's good rating.  I admit, I was in a hurry and didn't shop around.

A little more for working the weekend was acceptable, but when my tank was pumped  I was was told, \"once their truck was full, if I wanted the job completed, it'd cost me an additional $300 for them to come back and finish\".  I wasn't told about this additional cost before  the job started, only after the job was half done.  What choice did I have at that point. Looks like from other reviews, I'm not the only one overcharged for \"services\".\n\nQuoted $675 for a weekend call which was understandable, and an additional $200 for the acid which I was ok with, but ended up having to pay $1,200 to have the job completed.",

        "Description": "I just spent half of my day today 3/22/25 pulling my dishwasher out and checking everything that I could think of that would cause it to spill water all over my kitchen every time we tried to use it in the last two weeks. I was even making plans to put in a service request with my home warranty company. I reinstalled it and it was still doing the same thing. I did some more research on YouTube and checked one last thing\u2026\u2026 and wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2026.two weeks ago I had a technician from The Honest Plumber come out to replace my garbage disposal (through our home warranty company). This technician did not remove the plug  from the port on the garbage disposal before attaching the return line to it. That\u2019s why my dishwasher was making a mess in my kitchen every time. Needless to say I\u2019m pretty ticked off over it. I drilled a hole through the plug and used a wire hook to pull the plug out, reconnected the line and the dishwasher is back to normal. Of course I called my home warranty company to complain and all they can do is file some form to send to The Honest Plumber.  Maybe revisit some fundamentals with the younger technicians? My wife said it only took him a few minutes to install the garbage disposal but he obviously did not check his own work. Not a fan.\nP.S.\nThank you YouTube, you saved me from paying a $125 service fee for someone to come check out my dishwasher. I think I might just cancel my account with my home warranty company. This is not the first time I have had issues with their selected service providers, but first time with this one.  Rant over!",

In fact compared to the competitor who wanted to charge me $500 more for the same job, I felt like I had just won the lottery. Thanks again for all the help.",

        "Description": "I definitely do not recommend The \u201cHonest\u201d Plumber! Our water heater needed to be replaced so we went through our home warranty and they sent a technician from this company out. The time slot for our appointment was 8-12 and of course Tyler was running late. When he finally arrived I was told the job would take about an hour to an hour and half. He struggled to get the job done, I have cameras in my backyard and he really seemed to not know what he was doing looking back at the footage he looked extremely confused. He struggled for about 4 hours needing to leave and come back with more parts. Then at the end of the day he knocks on the door to tell me that in order to use the hot water heater I needed an extension cord to run from there to the closest power outlet about 5 feet away from the water heater. Also turned out he needed to come back the following day to finish the job. He asked what time worked for me and we made the appointment for 10am.\nThe follow day 10am rolled around 10:30 comes and he was a no show. No phone call or anything so I called him and no answer. I finally call the office and the lady who answered the phone told me he was in Tehachapi and he had said he could come at the end of the day. I was not comfortable with that because I didn\u2019t trust him to come finish the job being that he has already lied at this point. Finally at about 4:30 a different technician comes to finish the job and again we are responsible for finding an electrician to place a power outlet for the unit to be plugged in. We were not told this prior to getting the work done! So now we have an extension cord running outside just so we can have hot water. Tyler has ignored my husband\u2019s multiple calls. This is an extremely shady business that cares nothing for their customers. Stay away from this sorry company!",

        "Description": "These plumbers where assigned by our insurance company to install a moen flo. The install costs us an extra seven hundred dollars due a small pipe that they said needed to be replace. When I ask for receipt. They did not have a pen for their invoice. Nor did they ask and they wrote it in highlighter. They didn't put the prices of parts or labor. It took him less then an hour. In addition they were supposed to let our insurance company know that it was installed and turn in paper work to the insurance company that is was completed. They never did and it wasn't reported to our insurance. We almost were dropped from our insurance because of this. If you get a moan flow by your insurance do not let them assign you this plumber.",

        "Description": "These plumbers are a joke. I was assigned them through my home warranty company American Home Shield. I had a clogged drain. I paid my service fee of $125. The plumber came out and snaked my shower & told me he couldn\u2019t get the clog undone. He asked if I had a main drain clean out. I let him know I didn\u2019t know if I did because I was never shown one when I moved into the house. We both walked around my house and I showed him a box that had an opening under it that we never knew what it was . So he proceeded to take off the lid and tell me \u201coh no that\u2019s not the main drain clean out\u201d he told me if we pay extra money he could go on the roof and snake my vent from the roof but I had to pay extra because the warranty company doesn\u2019t cover him going on the roof. I told him it\u2019s ok , I\u2019ll think about it . He left and we had to hire another plumber at (A3 plumbing) the next day of $225. Which he was awesome. He came out and did the same , snaked my shower and my main drain vent on my roof , he couldn\u2019t get the clog unclogged. So he was determined to find my main drain clean out the one that\u2019s on the ground , we looked for a while of trying to find it with no success at first. So we started looking once more and I took him over to the same exact box I showed the plumber from The Honest Plumber & he lifted the lid and right away said \u201cdude this is your main drain clean out\u201d\n\nSo I would never hire any plumber from this company. How could u look at the main drain clean out and tell me that\u2019s not it. That\u2019s literally the basic info you should know as a plumber is how to identify a main drain clean out.",

The man that I talked to was rude on the phone and not personable in person. Said he would come back to finish the job and I didn\u2019t hear back at all. I had gave him 1000$ in cash and didn\u2019t hear anything after 2 weeks, I called them and I guess I got pushed to the done pile.",
